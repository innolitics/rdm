Task: >-
  The smallest piece of work that needs to be done.
Activity: >-
  A set of one or more interrelated or interacting tasks. An activity has an
  input, an output, and verification tasks. Records of activity outputs must be
  available in case of an audit.
Software System: >-
  All of the software in the project. The software system is decomposed into
  **software items**.
Configuration Item: >-
  An entity (e.g., compiler, software library, source code file, markdown
  document, Docker image, etc.) that can be uniquely identified using a
  particular version or Git hash.
Software Item: >-
  A module within the software system which may further decomposed into smaller
  software items. The **software system** is itself a software item, and thus
  the software items for a hierarchy. See the software design specification for
  a description of how the software system is decomposed into smaller software
  items.
Software Unit: >-
  A software item that is not further subdivided.
SOUP: >-
  **Software of unknown provenance**, also known as "off-the-shelf software",
  is a **software item** that has not been developed for the purpose of being
  incorporated into the medical device and for which adequate records of the
  development processes are not available. Most software dependencies are SOUP,
  and thus the terms are sometimes used interchangeably.
Problem Report: >-
  A record of actual or potential behavior of a software product that a user or
  other interested person believes to be unsafe, inappropriate for the intended
  use, or contrary to specification.
Known Anomaly: >-
  A problem report that we do not plan on addressing.
Change Request: >-
  A documented specification of a change to be made to the software system.
Software Requirement: >-
  A particular function that the software must support or some other
  constraint that the software must fulfill. Requirements describe the *what*,
  while specifications and designs describe the *how*.
Record: >-
  A special type of document that states the results achieved or provides
  evidence that activities were performed. Unlike other documents---such as
  this software plan---records are not usually revised after being approved.
Release: >-
  A version of the software system which may or may not be ready to be made
  publicly available.
Public Release: >-
  A *release* that is made available to medical device users.
Safety: >-
  Freedom from unacceptable risk. Note that it does not mean that there is no
  risk, as that is impossible. The perception of risk can depend greatly on
  cultural, socio-economic, and educational background, the actual and perceived
  state of health of the patient, and whether the hazard was avoidable.

  Our obligation as medical device software developers is to develop safe
  devices while also balancing economic constraints. A device that is never
  reaches the market can't help patients.
Risk: >-
  The combination of the probability of harm and the severity of that harm.
Harm: >-
  The physical injury or damage of health of people (patients or users), or
  damage to property or the environment.
Hazard: >-
  A potential source of harm.
Hazardous Situation: >-
  A circumstance in which people, property, or the
  environment is exposed to one or more hazard(s). Not every hazardous
  situation leads to harm.

  Software is not itself a hazard because it can not directly cause harm, but
  software can contribute towards producing hazardous situations.
RDM: >-
  The Regulatory Documentation Manager is a suite of tools that assists in the
  writing of a design history file, including generating documents and handling
  traceability.
