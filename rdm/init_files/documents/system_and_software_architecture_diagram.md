# Note

Our system and software architecture diagrams are included within the Software Design Specification.

[[FDA-SW:architecture-design-chart: This document is a pointer document that the FDA can more efficiently evaluate the submission. We suggest moving the diagrams into the SDS so that they can more easily link to other sections of that document.]]
